               <div class="inner">
                  <p>
                     One of the features that came with ES6 is the addition of let and const, which can be used for
                     variable declaration. The question is, what makes them different from good ol' var which we've been
                     using? If you are still not clear about this, then this article is for you.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Var</h2>
                  <p>
                     Before the advent of ES6, var declarations ruled. There are issues associated with variables
                     declared with var, though. That is why it was necessary for new ways to declare variables to
                     emerge. First, let's get to understand var more before we discuss those issues.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Scope of var</h2>
                  <p>
                     Scope essentially means where these variables are available for use. var declarations are globally
                     scoped or function/locally scoped. The scope is global when a var variable is declared outside a
                     function. This means that any variable that is declared with var outside a function block is
                     available for use in the whole window.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Hoisting of var</h2>
                  <p>
                     Variables declared with the var keyword are subject to hoisting. If we declare a variable (but do
                     not initialize it) at the end of the function, the JavaScript runtime will move it to the top of
                     its scope and, therefore, there will be no complaint by the runtime if we use that variable before
                     being declared.
                  </p>
                  <h2>The let Keyword in JavaScript</h2>
                  <p>
                     let is the improved version of var. let eliminates all the issues of var that we have talked about
                     in the previous section. let has a similar syntax to var but has a more strict scope.
                  </p>
                  <h2>let is Block Scoped</h2>
                  <p>
                     The let keyword should be used in situations where you want to declare a variable that should be
                     restricted to the block in which it is restricted. Also, variables declared with the let keyword
                     cannot be updated or re-declared. Here is an example of how to use let to declare variables in
                     JavaScript Note that the variable y declared with the let keyword is not accessible beyond the if
                     block in which it is declared. If we would have declared it with the var keyword, then it would
                     have been available, because var has global scope within a function. The following code snippet
                     will help you to better understand this train of thought:
                  </p>
                  <h2>The const Keyword in JavaScript</h2>
                  <p>
                     The const keyword follows the same rules as the let keyword. The only difference with const is that
                     const is used to define only constant values in JavaScript programs. The scoping principles of
                     const are the same as that of the let keyword. Like let, the variables declared with the const
                     keyword will also have scope restricted to the block in which they are declared. Some important
                     pointers for const include: const declares a variable with a constant value. Use the const keyword
                     if the variable that you are declaring should not be allowed to be reassigned in the future.
